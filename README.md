# Tezos OpenArtBlocks Backend
This project is part of OpenArtBlocks, an open-source self-hosted approach to creating generative art on the Tezos and Ethereum blockchains. It allows any artist to create generative art that is constructed only at the time of minting, thus making the art truly generative.

This is a node Express / Selenium server for generating the art from public blockchain-stored information.
It serves the art and its metadata during the sale, before switching to an IPFS-like network for long-term storage.
